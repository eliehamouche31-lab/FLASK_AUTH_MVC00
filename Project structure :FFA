 🏗️ Project Structure: FFA + Three-Tier Flow

This project’s architecture is inspired by modern software design principles, using the FFA methodology — Format, Function, Aesthetic — combined with a three-tier structure: UI → API → DATA.

🔹 FFA Pillars

Format – The structural layout of components and layers, defining clear responsibilities.

Function (Foundation) – The core business logic, rules, and stability that the system depends on.

Aesthetic – The user-facing experience: clarity, usability, and responsiveness.

🔹 Three-Tier Flow
   ┌───────────┐
   │    UI     │ ← Presentation Layer
   │ (Web UI)  │
   └────┬──────┘
        │
        ▼
   ┌───────────┐
   │    API    │ ← Application & Business Layer
   │(Server)   │
   └────┬──────┘
        │
        ▼
   ┌───────────┐
   │   DATA    │ ← Persistence Layer (MySQL)
   │(Database) │
   └───────────┘

🔹 Principles

Separation of Concerns

UI renders and collects input only

API enforces business rules, authentication, and validation

DATA layer is accessed exclusively via the API

Unidirectional Dependency

Flow is always UI → API → DATA

No layer bypasses the rules of the layer beneath it

Benefits

Maintainability – Layers evolve independently

Testability – Logic can be validated without UI coupling

Security – Client cannot bypass server rules

Scalability – UI and API scale independently

Longevity – Architecture remains adaptable for future technologies

🔹 Summary

By combining FFA pillars with a three-tier structure, this project ensures clarity, robustness, and future-proofing, making it suitable for modern web applications and complex software       
systems.
 Action	      |         Row state	                |           CursorManager call            |        	Notes
Update        |       	saved → editing	           |   cursorManager.openRow(row)	           |    Opens the row, enables inputs
Save	         | new → saved / editing → saved     |  	cursorManager.closeRow(row optional)  |   	Disables inputs, marks row saved
Cancel        | 	new → remove / editing → revert	 |   cursorManager.closeRow(row)	          |    Removes new rows or collapses editing row
Delete	       |   aved → removed	                 |    cursorManager.closeRow(row)	         |    Removes row from DOM, ensures any highlighting/focus reset
